# Code Refactor Starter Code
A general description of the system or project
This website is a landing page for a fictional company called "Horiseon" that I was assigned to refactor as part of a challenge during the UCF Coding Bootcamp.  It is designed to be used by others to evaluate my skills as a web developer.
The project status is important if the project is still in development. Use the file to mention planned changes and the development direction or indicate the completion date of the project.
The project is still in development as I plan to constantly improve it with new features as my skill set improves.  For example, I plan to add reactions such as the nav menu reacting when the mouse hovers over it and changing again when clicked on.
The requirements on the development environment for integration
This website should work with most common internet browser and any device, whether a fully optimized personal computer, phone, or tablet.
A guide to installation and use
There are no special instructions for installation.  It should be used to evaluate the creator's (me) skills as a web developer.
A list of technology used and any links to further information related to this technology
This website was created using HTML and CSS.  More technologies will be added in the future as my skills improve.
Open-source projects that the developers independently modify or expand should be contained in a section on “desired collaboration” in the readme.md file. How should problems be handled? How should developers advance the changes?
